Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Inline elements remain on the same line while block elements take up their own line. 
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? The element will stay in place according to the set values. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? Manipulate the box model of that element. 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default. Display block elements: div, p, ul Display inline: span, a, img
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? The box model identifies the spacing around content on a page that includes the area the content is in, area just around the content (padding), a border around both the conent and padding, and then the margin which is the final area around that. To fix the box model, define the values of each element of the box.
